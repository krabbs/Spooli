# üìÑ Spooli - the smart connected Prusa (MMU) Filament Monitor ‚Äì System Overview & Installation Guide

![Dashboard Overview](images/dashboard.png)
![Spool Table](images/spool_table.png)

This project provides a local monitoring and filament management solution for Prusa 3D printers using MMU3.

Unlike standard printer APIs, this system does not read filament usage directly from the printer, as this data is not exposed by the PrusaLink API. Instead, it achieves accurate tracking through a combination of synchronized live parsing and spool deduction.

When a print starts, the `app.py` backend downloads the active G-code file (as `.bgcode`), parses it line-by-line, and calculates the extrusion per tool. It identifies tool changes and accumulates usage over time. This parsing is done in a dedicated thread and kept synchronized with the live print progress and state received via PrusaLink.

The result: filament usage per tool is accurately tracked and deducted from assigned spools ‚Äî both for successful and aborted prints.

If the file is streamed directly (e.g. from PrusaSlicer without saving to USB), the `.bgcode` file is not available during print, and live parsing will be "blocked". Once the file becomes available again, usage will be reconstructed based on known progress and comparison to expected values.

A lightweight internal database manages all spools, their remaining weights, material, and color. Each slot (0‚Äì4 for MMU tools, 5 for direct mode) can be manually or automatically assigned.

The backend API is designed for easy integration via JSON-based GET and POST endpoints, allowing other tools or interfaces to hook into the spool data.

## üõ† Current Assumptions
- Designed for Prusa MMU3 systems
- Tested with PrusaSlicer 2.9.2
- Default setup supports 5 MMU slots + 1 fallback slot (non-MMU)

## ‚úÖ Features
- Live parsing of `.bgcode` for per-tool filament usage
- Inline editable spool database (adding and deleting)
- Remaining spool weight deduction with historical log
- Forecasting logic to detect insufficient filament early
- Filterable print history with spool consumption breakdown
- Dynamic reassignment of spools during print (Experimental)

## üöß Planned / Missing
- Better logging support for system
- Merging of spools post-print
- MQTT integration
- Prusa Connect API integration (waiting for API docs)
- Frontend settings panel
- G-code compatibility checks

## üêû Known Bugs
- Flow Rate change is not calculated. (very rare in gcodes since it is directly calculated in G1/GO E parameters.
- wiping tower and filament stamping before tool change maybe not correct. values are taken from gcode meta data. real use maybe different
- Forecasts can be delayed
- Unexpected restarts or network failures may cause looping

## üß© Components Overview

The system consists of three main parts:

### 1. `app.py` ‚Äì Flask Web Backend
- Hosts the UI and APIs
- Manages spool database
- Controls threading and monitoring and Gcode Analysis Loop

### 2. `monitor.py` ‚Äì Live Print Analyzer
- Downloads and parses G-code (triggered by app.py)
- Tracks tool changes and filament usage
- Feeds usage data to the frontend and database

### 3. `index.html` ‚Äì Frontend UI
- Displays progress and active tools
- Allows manual editing of spools
- Remapping of Spools
- Presents history and forecasting

### 4. 'settings'
- global variables 
- settings like prusa_usage = False which tells the loop to use prusa slicer estimates if print is successfully. Disabled because priming will not be covered

## üñº Frontend Explained
![active spools](images/dashboard.png)
Top Cards: Show active spools and live chart of filament usage (mm vs. % progress)
Bottom shows spools and history 

![active spools](images/spool_table.png)
![Print History](images/animationUI.gif)
Forecasting: /prognosis returns expected consumption to warn early if filament is insufficient
The black line indicates the usage for 100% of the current print 
White Red bars highlights negative spools. means there was an calculation error or another spool joined the tool. this can be manually solved with the spool database weight manipulation.
White Red Blinking bars means the print with this specific spool will result in an end of spool BEFORE print ends.
![active print](images/lastPrintUI.png)
This graphic is the main output of the consumption algorithm and can be used as a live visualization or print overview 

![Spool Database](images/SpoolDatabaseUI.png)
Slot Mapping amd spool database: Maps internal slots 0‚Äì5 to frontend view 1‚Äì6 (slot 5 ‚Üí "non-mmu")
Inline Editing: Supports editing fields like remaining weight, name, color. simple +/- formulas are allowed in the weight cell.

![Print History](images/history_table.png)
Csn be expanded by clicking 
History Table: Stores and displays past print jobs with filterable spool ID, status, file


Warning Banner: /noti dynamically shows info banners like "no sync", "analyze offline", etc.

Progress Indicators(at the very top) Frontend highlights blocked state and informs printing status. Note: if the live status calls "blocked" than the gcode is locked by prusa printer and will be available after the printing. means your consumption will be tracked after the print finished or aborted

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Real-time syncing requires `tool_live = 'live'`
- `bgcode` required for parsing
- Works for MMU3 and single-tool setups
- Data polling every 5 seconds
